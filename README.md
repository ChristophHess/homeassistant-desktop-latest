The App still works on Windows but does have a pop-up error every once and a while.  I do not know if it still works on other platforms.
I will not be maintaining this Project/App.  
I added this to my repository because it is no longer on mrvnklm repository.
I do not know why it is no longer on mrvnklm repository and if he doesn't want me to list the Project/App on my repository I will make it private.
